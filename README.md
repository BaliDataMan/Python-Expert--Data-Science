# Python Expert

Just the Machine Learning Algorithms will not help in building artificial intelligence systems. Technical langauage expertise is a must, which work as mediator between our imagination & machines to build AI systems. We are learning using Python which is most widely accepted language in Data Science. 

We will cover lots of Python Concepts in this repo, which will lead you to not just Data Science role but will open couple of opportunities where ever Python is highly involved. For instances - Python Developer, Data Engineer, Data Science, Web Crawling positions, Scripting language requirements and many more.

- This Python Expert REPO would be help to:
  - **Novice** to learn by **doing it** in jupyter notebooks.
  - **Experts** to brush up thier Python Concepts.


Let's start the learning with OOPs (Object Oriented Language) concepts.

**And will Update the repos with more important concepts.
